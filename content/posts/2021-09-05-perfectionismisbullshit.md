Perfectionism is bullshit.

It comes from a fear of judgement.
It is an inner [resistance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_Art_(book)>).
It kills creativity.

I've spent too many thought cycles trying to decide _what_ to create, and not enough _just creating_. Perfectionism stops me before I even start.

16 year old me was creatively free - playing with video cameras and photography equipment. I had no fear of judgement. My work didn't need to compete with the pros - I was a kid!
And yes - it sucked at first. But I _eventually_ got good! And I _really_ enjoyed it!
Now I sit in this creative rut because I can't help but compare myself to the pros. My work must _stand out_!

That mindset is bullshit. It needs to end. I need to be okay with creating garbage.

"Why should I post this? I'm terrible compared to X"
"I can't blog, I'm not a good writer"

Well, dummy, maybe you aren't a good writer _because_ you don't blog.

Seth Godin blogs daily and raves about the benefits of having this constraint. His posts aren't always special, but today [his post](https://seths.blog/2021/09/write-something/) is the universe sending me a message.

It doesn't have to be perfect. Or groundbreaking. Or good!
Just post it. We'll iterate tomorrow.
