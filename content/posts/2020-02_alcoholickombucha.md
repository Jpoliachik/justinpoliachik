I made a video about making alcoholic kombucha! Despite a few mistakes it turned out delicious!

This was my first _produced_ video in YEARS.

I plan on making videos regularly about the projects I'm actively experimenting with. Fermentation, home improvement, software development, whatever I'm building or tinkering with.

Filmed entirely using my iPhoneXs.

I used iMovie to edit this one, and even though it technically got the job done, it SUCKED. Maximum of two video layers means all the titles and overlays were composited outside of iMovie, and it auto-applies a ken burns effect to every. damn. image. I also wrecked my timeline countless times by the "smart snap" features. Long story short - I won't be using iMovie again.
