      <description>If you are developing with ReactNative and have not tried LayoutAnimation yet, you are missing out.
Coming to ReactNative as an iOS developer, I was worried about losing the convenience of CoreAnimation. UIView animations are so nice; set the desired view properties and go. ReactNative’s Animated API works similarly, but requires a state property for each desired animation. For complex views this gets messy fast.
Enter LayoutAnimation. Don’t let the slim documentation scare you.</description>
