It's time to redesign my personal website.
Why?
![justinpoliachik.com Before](/images/2021-12-24-website-redesign-origsite.jpg)

It's _boring!_

I'm much more creative and visual than the current site reflects.
It also doesn't support anything other than basic markdown posts.

I'd like to spice it up with some generative art, a friendlier bio, and a place for long-form content like projects and case studies.

### But Why Now?

- I'm inspired by seeing other personal sites, and in this new remote-first world I want to be open and inviting for others to connect with.
- I want to flex my design muscles a bit. This is a good exercise to solve problems for myself, learn Figma, and post about my process.
- Expand my opportunities - I want to stand out as both an engineer and designer.

## The Design

### Addressing the Problems:

#### Make it less boring

- Fix 'boringness' at its core with content, not pure "visual flair".
  Introduce more varieties of content - blog posts, projects, artwork, all with a personal touch.

#### Reflect my personality

- Add a good profile pic, a fun blurb, and some splashes of color.
- Important to keep things fluid and not too rigid.
- Needs to feel friendly and approachable - make people want to reach out and connect! Do this by being transparent and fun.

#### Support multiple media types

- Support posts with text, images, videos, code snippets, and custom widgets (eg p5js).
- I also need it to be incredibly easy to write and edit posts - this is paramount. Remove all hurdles to quickly adding content. Make simple posts easy, and make complex posts possible.
- Some content (blog posts) will be strictly dated and posted chronologically. Other content (long-running projects) won't. Have a place for both.

### Inspiration

These are some of the personal websites I love, and drew inspiration from:

- Matt Lim - [mattlim.me](https://www.mattlim.me/) - great 'projects' section. clean, simple layout with sprinkles of personal touch.
- Cole Townsend - [twnsnd.co](https://twnsnd.co/) - love the personal and authentic vibe. love the simple header.
- Paige Bailey - [dynamicwebpaige.github.io/info](https://dynamicwebpaige.github.io/info/) - amazing guiding principles.
- Aileen Shin - [aileen.co](https://www.aileen.co/) - beautiful project images.

## Iterations

#### v0: starting point

Basically copied [Matt Lim's](https://www.mattlim.me/) header and projects section, with an added "Recent Posts" section. Using generative art header with 'regenerate' button

#### v1: clean the header

I wanted a more minimalist header like [Cole's](https://twnsnd.co/). Tried out an 'intro' phrase within the generative art component.

#### v2: refining

Wasn't a fan of text within generative art - very busy and text could be hard to read based on dynamic background content. Tried out a split section for intro phrase and recent posts. Refined projects component. Made header sticky at the top.

#### v3: getting closer

Needed a focal point on page load. Tried that out here with a heavy intro, and tested out other section layouts.

#### v4: final!

I wanted full-width generative art for balance, and also didn't want to squeeze the recent posts. Went full-width to make everything responsive without big layout changes. Happy to proceed with this!

## Next Steps

I'm happy with the design and ready to build!

This was a fun project to force myself to slow down and go through the design process. I enjoyed flexing my design muscles a bit and getting more comfortable with Figma - it was my first project using it.
