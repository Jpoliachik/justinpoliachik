I took a second of video almost every day of 2016 and compiled it together.

I love doing this project because the effort is minimal, but it gives a great overview of the entire year. 1 second is _just_ enough to provide context for the day and help remember what I was doing.

2016 was a great year for me, I moved to Boston and took a ton of great trips. Cheers to 2017!
